    "Ultimately we will want to explore how well our docking method will be able to identify true binders and seperate them out from the non-binders. This is another way of saying we want our docking method to generate many true positives and only little (or now) false positives. This will only work if our dataset contains **both** true negative examples (i.e. non-binders) and true positive examples (binders). However, we only have access to true binders, because this is what is usually published in the literature. To circumvent this problem, we will have to generate virtual non-binders, also called decoys. These decoy molecules are generated using the method of \"Property-matched Decoys\". For this to work, we will first cluster our molecules and then pick the cluster centers as the input for the `DUD-E` webserver (dude.docking.org/generate). Run the cell below to retrieve the smiles codes of the cluster centers.\n",
